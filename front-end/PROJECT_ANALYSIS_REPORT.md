- `Hero.jsx` - Homepage hero section

**Product Components:**
- `ProductGrid.jsx` - Product listing grid
- `ProductDetails.jsx` - Individual product details
- `FeaturedCollection.jsx` - Featured products section
- `NewArrivals.jsx` - New arrivals section
- `GenderCollectionSection.jsx` - Gender-based collections

**Page Components:**
- `Home.jsx` - Homepage
- `Login.jsx` - User authentication
- `Register.jsx` - User registration
- `Profile.jsx` - User profile
- `MyOrdersPage.jsx` - Order history

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Modern React Practices**: Uses functional components with hooks
2. **Consistent Component Structure**: Well-organized component hierarchy
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
4. **Clean Code**: Readable and maintainable code structure
5. **Modern Build Tools**: Vite for fast development and building
6. **ESLint Configuration**: Proper linting setup for code quality

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Folder Naming**: "components" is misspelled as "componets"
2. **TypeScript**: No TypeScript implementation (only dev dependencies present)
3. **Testing**: No testing framework or test files found
4. **State Management**: No global state management solution (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
5. **API Integration**: No HTTP client library (Axios, Fetch wrapper)
6. **Documentation**: Limited project documentation

## Features Analysis

### Implemented Features
- **User Authentication**: Login and registration pages
- **Product Catalog**: Comprehensive product display with categories

- **Product Categories**: Men's and Women's clothing sections

### Mock Data
The project includes comprehensive mock product data (`src/data/products.js`):
- 60+ products with detailed specifications
- Categories: Top Wear, Bottom Wear
- Gender-specific collections (Men's and Women's)
- Product attributes: prices, descriptions, sizes, colors, materials
- High-quality placeholder images

## UI/UX Assessment

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Clean, modern with black/white/gray base
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean readability
- **Component Design**: Card-based layouts with consistent spacing
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states and smooth transitions

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- Responsive navigation with mobile drawer

## Technical Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add TypeScript**: Migrate to TypeScript for better type safety
2. **Implement Testing**: Add Jest + React Testing Library
3. **Fix Spelling**: Rename "componets" to "components"
4. **API Integration**: Add HTTP client (Axios) for backend communication
5. **State Management**: Implement global state management solution

### Medium Priority
1. **Error Handling**: Add error boundaries and proper error handling
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and code splitting
3. **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags and proper HTML semantics
4. **Accessibility**: Improve ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Form Validation**: Add proper form validation

### Low Priority
1. **PWA Features**: Consider Progressive Web App implementation
2. **Internationalization**: Add i18n support for multiple languages
3. **Advanced Features**: Wishlist, product comparison, reviews
4. **Analytics**: Integrate analytics tracking

## Security Considerations

### Current Status
- Basic form handling without validation
- No authentication token management visible
- No input sanitization implementation

### Recommendations
